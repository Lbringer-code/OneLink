## OneLink

- Share all your links in one go

### UseCases

- As a user, I want to quickly drop multiple links under a topic so I can group related content in one place.
- As a user, I don’t want to create an account or log in — it should be a one-time, frictionless experience.
- As a user, I want to add a short title and description for each link so that others understand the context.
- As a user, I want to preview all added links before generating the final page.
- As a user, I want to choose whether the shared page should expire or stay permanent.
- As a user, I want to generate one clean, shareable link that displays my grouped content neatly.
- As a user, I want to copy and share the generated link instantly with anyone (no sign-in required).
- As a recipient, I want to open that link and see a simple, readable layout of titles, subtext, and URLs.
- As a recipient, I want to open each link directly from that shared page.
- Add light/dark mode ( optional )
